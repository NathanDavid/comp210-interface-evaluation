          <h2>I found through my quantitative data that there was an even split between whether or not the person playing understood the objectives, this has a slight correlation with how many people thought the phone was explained in enough detail. <br /> Across all playthroughs of the game I recorded an average of 7 minutes and 19 seconds to find and use the first pickup within the game. The lowest time taken was 6 minutes and 15 seconds with the longest time being 8 minutes 31 seconds. <br />Even though there was a slight correlation in my data, I wouldn't say it was sufficient enough give an accurate view on the players. To remedy this I could simplify the questions I asked on the questionnaire to make it more understandable.</h2>

          <h2>Through my qualitative responses I have found that it would improve the user experience if the player had more UI elements such as prompts for pickups to make it easier to understand how to progress through the game or having a map that explains where you are and where you can go with the current key cards that you have. <br />It also shows that there needs to be more coherent so that the players can understand the plot and objectives of the game more effectively.</h2>
